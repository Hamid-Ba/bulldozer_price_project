    "# Bulldozer Price Prediction\n",
    "# Predicting 🚜 Price using machine learning\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting Bulldozer Price based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",

    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",

    "## 1.Problem Definition\n",
    "> Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a \"blue book\" for bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Data\n",
    "The data for this problem is split into three parts:\n",
    "* `Train.csv` is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* `Valid.csv` is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* `Test.csv` is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "also you can access the data from 👉🏼 : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Evaluation\n",
    ">The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.Features\n",
    "> There are several fields towards the end of the file on the different options a machine can have.  The descriptions all start with \"machine configuration\" in the data dictionary. check the `Data Dictionary.xlsx`"
